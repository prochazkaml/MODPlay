 * NOTE: `len` specifies the number of samples, NOT BYTES.
 * This MOD player renders in 16-bit stereo, so the `*buf` array
 * is expected to have `len` * 4 allocated bytes of memory.
 * 
 * The samples are interleaved as follows:
 * 
 * Index | Value
 * ------+------
 * 0     | Sample 0, left channel
 * 1     | Sample 0, right channel
 * 2     | Sample 1, left channel
 * 3     | Sample 1, right channel
 * ...   | ...
 * 
 * This makes it compatible with many popular audio output
 * libraries without any extra conversion (SDL, PortAudio etc).
